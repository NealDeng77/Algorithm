/*
 * Cracking the coding interview. 3.3 stack of Plates
 * Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
 * Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some
 * threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be
 * composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity,
 * SetOfStacks. push() and SetOfStacks.popO should behave identically to a single stack
 * (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
 * FOLLOW UP
*  Implement a function popAt ( i n t index) which performs a pop operation on a specific substack.
